## SEa sponges may hold key to fighting killer infections ##

The solution to vexing--and deadly--problem for modern medicine could be lying on the ocean floor.

Just like some insects have evolved to resist synthetic chemical insecticides, new infectious diseases have emerge over the last 20 years that can't be controlled by the antibiootics doctors have at thier disposal.


IT could be sea sponges to the rescue, say a team of scientists, including some from Florida Atlantic University.

In a study published in the journal Frontiers in Microbiology, researchers identified several chemical compounds produced by microbes that live in deep-sea sponges. These secretions show promise in defeating antibiotic-resistant infections, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Colostridium difficile(C. diff), which menace patients in hospitals and long-term nursing facilities and cause numberous deaths every year.

"There is this desperate need to find new antibiotics" said Peter McCarthy, a marine microbiology professor at Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute. "We have picked up many sponges that have never been seen before. So that led us to believe they contained microbes that had never been seen before."

The Center for Disease Control and Prevention puts C. diff at the most urgent level of threat.

As part of the sponges' natural defense against other organisms invading their space, these microbes produce compounds that keep the invaders away and sponges thriving undersea.

They've been testing how chemicals in the microes that keep the sponges healthy react against the antibiotic-resistant diseases that threaten mankind.

Triggering the microbes to secrete these compounds in the lab, scientists have found the secretions are effective against deadly bacterial pathogens when they go head to head in a petri dish.

With funding from the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, researchers are identifying how these microbes produce the antibacterial compounds, so mankind can do the same.

"We don't fully understand why they are making chemicals," McCarthy said. "We do not yet understand the ecology of it"
