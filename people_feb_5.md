"She is the first peoson to remind us that all of the work she did was as part of a team," Shetterly says, "and that one of her greatest joys was rolling up her sleeves and working side by side with other brilliant people. It's a sign of her belief in her own gifts that she's the first ot call attention to the work of others."

Johson remains huble about the nature of her celebrated work. She talks in terms of solving problems and used the phrases "just doing my job" as a sincere mantra.

It means everything to Johnson that a few generations of young women and girls ahve been inspired by her story to seek educations and careers in the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering and math. She says that means more to her than being on stage at the Academic Awards or receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

That's another part of message she tries to convey, not only to young girls but to everyone: FIind a career that challenges you and excites you, and the rest will take care of itself.

"She's the only perosn I know who says she enjoyed every single day of her career at work--and she truly means it," Shetterly says. "She brought intellectual talent to her job, but she also brought something more: an avid sense of curiosity about the world and an openness to other people. SHe brings that to the rest of her life as well. We can all takes a lesson form how Katherine Johnson has lived her life."

Johnson says she still tires to abide by a piece of advice her father gave her--to try learn something new every day.

But what comes after celebrating her centennial weekend with a road trip, a statue and a scholarship, she is asked. Any early plans for her 101st birthday?

She smiles.

"Just ot live," she says. "jsut to stay living."
